## Nukleus `streams` Transport
Flow control with `WINDOW` update frames are managed inside the transport.

Requires external configuration of directory where streams are discovered.

```
# accept new unidirectional (simplex) streams at "receiver" from source "sender"
# for routed reference ${routedRef} (required)
# set initial window size to 8192 (required)
# on explicit partition "part0" (optional: default to any partition)
# with explicit correlation ${correlationId} (optional: default to any correlation)
#
# note: throttle (default "on") is not relevant on accept for "simplex" transmission (not writing)
