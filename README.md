## Nukleus `stream` Transport
Flow control with `WINDOW` update frames are managed inside the transport.
Requires external configuration of directory where streams are discovered.

```
# expect new streams from "source"
# set initial window size to 8192
accept nukleus://stream/source
       option window 8192

# receive BEGIN w/ extension
accepted
read extension [0x...]

# expect data on explicit partition (optional)
read option partition "part1"

# receive DATA w/ extension
read [0x...]
read extension [0x...]
read flush

# send RESET
abort

# receive END w/ extension
closed extension [0x...]
```

```
# send BEGIN w/ extension
# on explicit partition "part0" (optional)
# and initial window size to 2048 (optional: default 0 before first WINDOW frame)
connect nukleus://stream/target#partition
        option parition "part0"
        option window 2048

# switch writes to explicit partition (optional)
